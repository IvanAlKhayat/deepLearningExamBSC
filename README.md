# Deep Learning Exam Project

This repository contains my solutions for a university exam on **Deep Learning**.  
The notebook demonstrates text preprocessing, feature extraction, and the implementation of neural networks with **Keras** for classification tasks.  

## ðŸ“‚ Contents
- `501019_exam_session_june.ipynb` â€” the main notebook with all exercises and solutions
- `requirements.txt` â€” Python dependencies for running the notebook
- `README.md` â€” project description  

## ðŸš€ What I Did
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Text feature extraction with **CountVectorizer** and **TF-IDF**
- Data scaling and encoding with **scikit-learn**
- Neural network modeling with **Keras** (Dense layers, Dropout, Regularization)
- Model training, evaluation, and F1-score reporting
- Exploration of different preprocessing strategies and model performance  

## ðŸ“š Libraries Used
The following main libraries were used in this project:
- **numpy** â€” numerical operations  
- **pandas** â€” data manipulation  
- **scikit-learn** â€” preprocessing, vectorization, train/test split, F1-score evaluation  
- **keras / tensorflow** â€” neural network modeling and training  
- **re** â€” regex-based text cleaning  


## ðŸ”§ Installation
Clone this repository and set up the environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IvanAlKhayat/deep-learning-exam.git
cd deep-learning-exam
pip install -r requirements.txt
